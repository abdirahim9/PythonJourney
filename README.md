# Day 1: Hello Script
- 'input()': Asks for 'name' and 'age'-stores what I type.
- 'for _ in range(3)': Loops 3 times-repeats the questions.
- 'tries += 1': Counts each loop-tracks attempts.
- 'print()': Shows  greeting with variables -e.g., "Hello, Abdirahim! At 27, attempt My first Python script-mastery starts here!

# Day 2: Calculator Script
-'float(input())': Takes number-converts strings to decimals.
-'Math ops: '+', '-', '*', '/', '//', '%' -compute on 'num1','num2'.
-'print(f"...)': Formats results-shows all 6 operations cleanly.
My calc does sums to remainders-math in python is on!

# Day 3: Logic Script
-'int(input())': Takes age-coverts to integer.
-'if/else': Decides adult/minor-nested 'if checks 21 or 13.
-'for i in range(5)': Counts 0-4-just loops!
-'while count <5': Counts with control-stops at 5.
-'print(f"...)': Shows decisions and counts-logic rules!
My script thinks now-control flow is mine!
